                Have you ever been at an event and disliked the music being played?<br/> The idea of OpenDJ is to solve this problem by applying open source principles to the music playlist of an event.

            <h3 class="slide-title">How does it work?</h3>
            <p>
                Participants of an event can contribute to the playlist by adding tracks. Everybody can see and add to the playlist. No special accounts, apps, or access to local WiFi needed. Access to OpenDJ works with every smartphone and internet browsers, even on
                low bandwith connections. Tracks can be liked or hated (click on the emojis!) and move up or down the list, depending on the feedback.<br>

            <h3 class="slide-title">What are Curators?</h3>
            <p>
                Curators can edit the playlist (sorting/grouping by genre, deleting). Curators get more detailed information about a track (e.g. genre, bpm, danceability, likes/dislikes by users). There is no special skill needed to be curator, just a sense for music.
                Of course you could hire a professional DJ as additional curator if you like.</p>

            <h3 class="slide-title">Where does the music come from?</h3>
            <p>
                The music is being played by a streaming provider, e.g. Spotify. As Event Owner, you need to provide your streaming provider credentials. OpenDJ is running in the internet and uses your streaming provider APIs to execute the playlist on a local device
                on your behalf.<br> For this to work, you have to consent to Spotify that OpenDJ is allowed to control your devices. You can revoke the permission for OpenDJ to access your Spotify Devices at any time (using the Spotify
                web page).<br> The participants of your event just don't care about these details. They contribute to the playlist and enjoy the music they want to hear.
