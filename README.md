# OpenDJ -Apply Open Source principles to the Dance Floor! 

## Vision
Have you ever been at an event and disliked the music being played?  




The vision of OpenDJ is to solve this problem by applying open source principles to the music playlist of an event:

Participants of an event can contribute to the playlist by adding tracks. Everybody can add the the playlist, no accounts needed, no access to local devices. In a future version, users can like/dislike a track they see on the playlist.

<img src="docs/img/OpenDJExampleViewCurator.png" width="25%" align="right"> Curators can edit the playlist (sorting/grouping by genre, deleting) - they are like the maintainer of an open source project. They get more detailed information about a track (e.g. genre, bpm, danceability, likes/dislikes by users). There is no special skill needed to be curator, just a sense for music. In a future version, curators will be able to pre-listen to a track in the playlist.

The music is being played by a streaming provider, e.g. Spotify. OpenDJ is running in the internet and uses streaming provider APIs to execute the playlist on a local device (which might be connected to the PA system of a party location).  




## Try it out
A prototype is up and running: [demo.opendj.io](http://demo.opendj.io)
You can add tracks by using the blue "Add" button.
In the demo, tracks are skipped every 20s (they are not actually being played). And if the playlist is empty, it is out-filled with some example tracks.
